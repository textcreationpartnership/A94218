            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had the liberty of two days to review this ſmall piece, before it fully paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Printers hands. In this time I gathered the <hi>Errata</hi> which thou ſeeſt at the end of this; and have taken liberty to Preface it a little, for thy better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That which now comes to thy hands was written ſome yeares ago; one part is in anſwer to a paper ſent me by an eminent Gentleman in the Weſt; who diſliking mine, and ſome other Miniſters practice, as to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> did hereby
<pb facs="tcp:152975:3"/>put us to vindicate the truth, and our ſelves, as to the way walked in. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had written this, I kept it by me many moneths, not ſuffering any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to be taken, nor the papers to go farther then the ſight of ſome deare friends about us. I will not burthen thee with recitall of the cenſures which attended and prevented its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth; ſuch and ſo many, that had I conſulted with fleſh and blood, and been tender of mine own eaſe, this had been adjudged to ſilence. I was at length prevailed with to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the manuſcript, and ſo it came into the hands of ſome reverend Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>London,</hi> who thought it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a more publick view: Upon a letter from one of theſe I conſented to a publication, upon this ground (as the Lord knowes) that I apprehended and hoped ſome good might be done by it. Since this, theſe papers have layen in <hi>London,</hi> expecting the preſſe, and under it, more then a years ſpace. Theſe circumſtances have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:152975:3"/>this uſe, to excuſe the delay of the whole, and the unſeaſonableneſſe of a part, <hi>viz.</hi> that which relates to Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi> who hath ſince been anſwer'd by diverſe, and hath himſelf replyed unto one; here is not roome for much more; onely this. There is not one Word added to what I wrote at firſt: I am likely to have occaſion to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in this argument, which if the Lord call me unto, I hope to keep time better, and to amend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which ſhall be ſhewen me in this. This way of publick edifying is new to me, it's the leſſe marvel if I faile ſomewhat in matter and manner; though I appeare for ſeparation (in a ſenſe,) yet am I ſo far in love with Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I hold it my duty to promote it among the godly, and (what I may) to bring all reformed Churches into it. I know no greater diſhonour lying (this day) upon the Goſpel, then our diviſions. O let me beg of thee one ſad and tender thought of this grievous evil. I muſt needs ſay, that
<pb facs="tcp:152975:4"/>not a few of the godly ſeeme much more inclined to peace, then they have been; bleſſed be his Name who hath wrought this. What, is it hard for men of the ſame ſpirit to walk in one way? Doth not the Lord ſpeake this to all the godly in the Land, in the language of Providence? [when they cannot rule over one another, they will agree;] God hath done the one, let us do the other: Shall leſſer diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences alway divide thoſe who are one in the great things of the Kingdome of Chriſt? I am deceived, if ever Church-Reformation and Conſtitution prove comfortable and ſucceſſefull among us, unleſſe holding communion with other Churches, come to be a matter of more weight with us. I have no more but to commend this poore labour to the bleſſing of God, and ſubſcribe,</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The Conceſſions are of private conference, examination of ſome perſons, the excommunicating of others; theſe we accept of. And to ſay truth, in ſome of theſe is more granted then is deſired; namely the inveſting the Miniſter with power of excommunication, or cenſuring alone, which many learned men make an act of juriſdiction, belonging, <hi>non uni, ſed unitati,</hi> (as they expreſſe themſelves) to the whole Church, or to the Officers of the Church, but not to the Miniſter alone. But he ſpeaks in this the opinion of the Sclool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ſeem (to us) to put Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſures into the Miniſters hands alone. Whil'ſt this opinion makes rather for us then againſt us, we ſhall not contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, but take it for granted, and to

                  <p>It was our fault (for a time,) and it may be ſome other mens fault at this day. We ſaw cauſe to be humbled for our omiſſion of this duty among other offences, as to the Lords Supper: And we now conceive the inſtitution to be ſo ſtrict, as admits of no deniall, nor of long delay: For ſome years paſt, we have not been guilty of this forbearance; there hath been a frequent uſe of this as of all other Ordinances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, ſo that all deſirous, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with a little paines might partake thereof.

                  <p>Firſt, we do not examine all, as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; ſuch as are more knowing and willing, do only make profeſſion of their faith and knowledge; ſome in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, others more privately. Many have been admitted without having a queſtion asked them, and we can truly averre that we examine none, but ſuch as well may be ſuſpected of incompetent knowledge; ſo that here is no need of diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That of omitting altogether the uſe of the Sacrament, muſt have no place in the queſtion neither; for our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and judgements oppoſe it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, About convening from diverſe Pariſhes, this will but confound the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, if mixed with it: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Moſt of thoſe admitted were taken in,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152975:19"/>not without their proper Paſter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as were admitted of other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, are perſons juſtly offended with the groſſeneſſe of their adminiſtrations at home, where no ſeparation at all is made, nor any cheriſhing of deſires that way. The lawfulneſſe of this we ſhall aſſert in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place.</p>
                  <p>As the Queſtion is ſtated, there are ſo many things laid together, as would make <hi>plaustraria argumenta,</hi> tedious Syllogiſmes, and ſo beget confuſion in the diſpute. The ſtate of the preſent difference may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expreſſed in this,<note place="margin">The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtated.</note> or the like manner; that is, Whether in the reforming of a long corrupted Church, it be neceſſary that all the Members thereof do ſubmit to ſome examination, or trial of their knowledge, before they be admitted unto the Lords Table?</p>
                  <p>This Queſtion we fear not to maintain in the Affirmative. Here we ſuppoſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our Churches, and therefore with men well ſatisfied with their preſent frame and temper, not looking on them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any ſuch diſorder, as we ſuppoſe, with ſuch we deſire not much to diſpute; We can accept little of reaſon, or truth from men of that minde.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It ſeemes to us that this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152975:19"/>agrees not with it ſelfe, for it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes examination as precedaneous to this ordinance, and yet yields it in ſome caſes to be practiſed. Can the paper allow the keeping back of ſome, yea of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as well as ſcandalous, and yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely oppoſe examination (as previous) without which ignorance cannot be well known? Promiſcuous adminiſtring, muſt either ſtand, or fall. If ſtand, then no reformation can be rationally hoped for. And if it fall, let us be taught how the admiſſion of all ſorts formerly practiſed can be redreſſed without examination, or ſome equivalent courſe. At preſent we ſhall bend our ſelves to maintaine the neceſſity of examination unto the right uſe of the Lords Supper in our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and that ſuch as refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thereunto are deſervedly excluded.</p>
                  <p>When we ſay, examination ſhould be previous (as the Author ſpeaks) or a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Antecedent, we underſtand not a Phyſical Antecedent, as if it were eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to this duty, or Antecedent <hi>ſuâ natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ,</hi> for then we ſhould examine as often as we admit, which is not done. Self-examination is a neceſſary Antecedent at all times, and Miniſterial at ſome times; an Antecedent it is, <hi>non phyſicè, ſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152975:20"/>&amp; ex hypotheſi,</hi> that is, upon a ſuppoſition of a general corruption in our Churches.

                  <p>In his inſtitutions we may, and muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the rule and example of Chriſt, his example being part of our rule. In theſe inſtitutions ſomewhat is eſſential, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, ſomewhat circumſtantial.</p>

                  <p>This is ſaid, not proved. It appears not to us, that any ſuch thing was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſts action of waſhing, as is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.

                  <p>Not to mention that ſome learned men ſuppoſe this ſet down, <hi>John</hi> 13th. to be done after the Sacrament.

No, <hi>But that ye ſhould do as I have done,</hi> that is, <hi>waſh one anothers feet,</hi> namely be humble, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, condeſcending; the myſterie of this action was to be revealed hereafter, as <hi>verſe</hi> 7. Therefore not of obvious concernment to their preparation.<note place="margin">It was an example of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, as the plaine words of Chriſt are; although by occaſion of that example, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrine was inferred of our ſpiritual waſhing by Chriſt, once wholly unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and daily of our feet for our daily tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Who will believe that theſe words, <hi>waſh one anothers feet,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, <hi>Examine your ſelves.</hi> Again, you ſay, Chriſts waſhing is anſwered by the Miniſters exhortations, (and why not by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining as well?) whereas we thinke that a leſſon to examine themſelves, would have ſtood better, if they had been bid to waſh their own feet. The deficiency of ſuch general exhortations we ſhall touch upon anon.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, what if Chriſt did not examine his Diſciples? doth it follow that we may not examine ſome, or all in our Aſſemblies? Rather in his adminiſtring only unto Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, he teacheth us to exclude the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152975:23"/>ignorant and wicked; theſe (admitted) were his choice Diſciples, he had the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, and ſeveral others beſides; but theſe as more infirme were not called, as a Learned man obſerves. Beſides, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine none that are taken to be Diſciples; but if we ſhould, reall Diſciples will not refuſe to ſatisfie the Church, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage weaker Brethren by a voluntary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their ſaith, which is the moſt Diſciples are put unto. In ſhort, Chriſt had communicated before with thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples in the Paſſeover, which was the ſame in ſubſtance with this inſtitution; therefore he needed not examine thoſe that were admitted before.</p>
                  <p>The moſt zealous Aſſertors of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation preſſe not any to this after their firſt, or once admiſſion in a due way.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Chriſt admitted <hi>Judas</hi> to the Communion, therefore what need of ſuch prying?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> When this is diſputed out to the laſt, nothing is concluded againſt our judgements or practice. The concluſion is, that though Chriſt ſaw <hi>Judas</hi> to be an hypocrite, yet he admits him. Now what followes? therefore hypocrites may be admitted. Who thinks the contrary? we are of the ſame minde, we ſpeak of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding profane and ignorant perſons, and we are told that an hypocrite was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. It is not in mens power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude hypocrites, or ſecret ſinners, but open. This is truly to paint a houſe which hath no foundation. You muſt not expect from us ſuch a preſident as you call for, while it is moſt remote from our thoughts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152975:24"/>any from Gods Ordinances, who profeſſing Religion are ſo innocent in their lives, as you ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Were we of your opinion, we ſhould manage this Argument (about <hi>Iudas</hi>) in another ſort, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Chriſt knew <hi>Iudas</hi> to be a wicked man, yea, a reprobate, and yet admitted him; therefore Miniſters may not keep back ſuch as they ſee, and know to be wicked ones: Thus Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> and the <hi>Eraſtians;</hi> and this is plain dealing, and the concluſion is directly againſt us. But here alſo the argument is weak, and will tremble in its arraignment at the barre of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>As to the admiſſion of <hi>Iudas,</hi> we do ingeuouſly confeſſe that it is ſomewhat doubtful to us,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> of Heaven in his Book. <hi>Tit. 4.</hi> Laſt Things. <hi>p. 144.</hi>
                     </note> whether he did receive or not? but we incline ſtrongly to the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. It is one of the things that we look to have our knowledge perfected in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; as whether <hi>Iephta</hi> ſlew his daughter, or conſecrated her to Virginity? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Naaman</hi> were a true Convert, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound? So whether <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or not? yet this example of <hi>Iudas</hi> being thought to go farre in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, we have ſomewhat heedfully ſearched, and weighed, not only the texts
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152975:24"/>of Scripture, but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities objected. And firſt we do not finde the conſonancy ſpoken of to be among the Ancients, but ſee ſome of them denying, others doubting of <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving. It muſt be granted that diverſe of the Fathers vote with this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but theſe are balanced by multitudes of the beſt Moderne Lights, who are of another minde; The Fathers might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this from one another, without due looking into the Text. They are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to erre in this point, by taking the ſop to be the Sacrament, as theſe words of <hi>Auſtine</hi> diſcover<note n="*" place="margin">Num enim mala erat bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella quae tradita eſt <hi>Judae</hi> à Domino? abſit, medicus non daret venenum: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem medicus dedit, ſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignè accipiendo ad perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem accepit, &amp;c. <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> in <hi>6.

And yet theſe are not all, we could name more, yea, double to this number, beſides learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Papiſts not a few. Now judge what the conſonancy is worth, which is ſpoken of in the Paper: The Reader will ſee we are not behinde for humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. But if the authorities of men faile to determine, yet the Text (he ſaith) is pregnant. What Text? <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.14. But is this the only Text to be eyed in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie? He that reads <hi>John</hi> 13.30. ſhall finde a Text more pregnantly proving the direct contrary. Theſe Texts do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict one another, (thou that readeſt, beware of that inference.) It is our dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde, which doth hinder our reſolution in theſe matters.</p>
                  <p>Although we cannot largely diſpute theſe Texts, yet we will ſtudy the help of ſuch as deſire light in this point. That whith makes the point doubtful, we take to be the number of the Suppers, which were about one and the ſame time. Some maketheſe to be three, others but two, <hi>viz.</hi> the typical, and the euchariſtical. It is probable that there was a third, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a common Supper. The order of theſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152975:26"/>is alſo controverted. By the grant of all, <hi>Judas</hi> was preſent at one of theſe. For he ſate down with the twelve, ſome ſay at the common Supper only,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aarons</hi> R. p. 461.</note> as learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gilleſpy;</hi> others, at both the common Supper, and at the Paſſeover, but not at the holy Supper. Now <hi>Judas</hi> might be preſent at one, or both the former,<note place="margin">

                  <p>As to that Text of <hi>Luke</hi> 22. Divines do note a tranſpoſition, that is, ſetting down that laſt, which was done firſt, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>A thing not ſtrange, being found in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of Scripture. As in <hi>Geneſis</hi> the ſecond Chapter.<note place="margin">Innocent <hi>the third,</hi> lib. 4. de Miſſ. c. 13. <hi>See alſo</hi> Beza. Salmeron. Maldonate. <hi>in loc.</hi>

The reaſons are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> put that before the inſtitution, which <hi>Luke</hi> puts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. See <hi>Luke</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22, 23. compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.26.

                  <p n="3">3. The note of the laſt Tranſlaters of the Bible is alſo conſiderable, who at the 21. <hi>v.</hi> ſet a note of theirs (¶) ſhewing that there begins another matter, therefore not a continued Hiſtory orderly ſet down.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor doth <hi>Luke</hi> ſay, that Chriſt ſpake the words after the Sacrament, but only ſets them down.</p>
                  <p>Now as to that other Text, <hi>John</hi> 13. which we alledge; It proves <hi>Judas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted before the Sacrament was received. <hi>Sanè</hi> Johannes <hi>quiddam ejuſmodi ſubindicare videtur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Victor Antiochenus,</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>Prinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another more fully we may gather from hence,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Diodat.</hi> in locum.</note> that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not communicate of our Saviours Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>The force of this reaſon lies in the word (immediately;) what it ſignifies, every En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-man knowes, that is, inſtantly, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                  <p>Now this being granted, as it is, that the Sop was not given at the holy Supper,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152975:27"/>but before; how could ſo remarkable an action as receiving the Sacrament inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, and yet <hi>Iudas</hi> be ſaid to go forth immediately?</p>
                  <p>Truly, neither truth, nor good Engliſh will ſuffer this; to ſay that immediately ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a ſhort time, is a miſerable ſhift, and an abuſe of the word.

                  <p>It is alſo conſiderable to obſerve the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner of Chriſts ſpeaking, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time without exception, and ſometime with it. When <hi>Iudas</hi> was preſent, with exception, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 18. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward without exception, moſt ſweetly,<note place="margin">See our Engliſh Divines in their large <hi>Annot.</hi> in <hi>2.

After <hi>Judas</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, how his ſpeech varies; If <hi>Iudas</hi> were preſent, then theſe ſpeeches muſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152975:28"/>be applied to him, which may not be granted. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Gerrard</hi> expound theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>(That which thou doeſt, do quickly)</hi> as a caſting out of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Get thee gone from the company of my Apoſtles, and out of my ſight.

                     </note> ſhould it be granted that <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive, yet much were not gained. <hi>Iudas,</hi> as one ſayes well, is but a bad port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to let in men to the Sacrament. There was nothing in him diſcernable (by men,) contrary to his profeſſion. There was no viſible cauſe for his excluſion. The Apoſtles thought as well of him as of themſelves, and did not ſo much as ſuſpect him, though he were known to Chriſt as God. But Chriſt in hir Ordinance dealt as man (miniſterially) as a Pattern to us, who are to admit viſible Diſciples, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to deſcend into their hearts. When the woman taken in adultery was brought before Chriſt, he dealt as a man, called for her accuſers, and when none came, diſmiſſed her; and yet he knew her (as God) to be guilty, and therefore ſayes, <hi>Go, and ſin no more;</hi> Unleſſe Chriſt as a Miniſter had known <hi>Iudas</hi> to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, what reaſon had he to exclude
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152975:28"/>him? Now let the Reader judge, what life is left in this Argument about <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving, which is found and proved to be ſo feeble in its conſequence, and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</p>

But in that Chapter I finde a precept, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf;</hi> none, that he ſhould neceſſarily paſſe the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Paſtor. Between the proper
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152975:29"/>examination of himſelf, and eating, and drinking; no other thing intervenes, and therefore this very Commentary is made upon that Text by pathetical <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> He doth not bid one man to examine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but every man himſelf, making the judgement private, and the tryal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſſes. <hi>Pareus</hi> ſtrikes in uniſons with that ancient Father: The Apoſtle ſaith not, The Prieſt ſhal examine, or prove them, but every man himſelf. So doth <hi>Sarcerius,</hi> He commands not that one ſhould be approved to another; but each one to himſelf, as long before <hi>Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus</hi> accounted every mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be hisbeſt director in this caſe, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Stromat.</hi> By what authority then can he be rejected that hath examined himſelf? And to ſuſpect that any have not examined themſelves, that ſhall profeſſe to have done ſo, without pregnant probability to the contrary, how can it be compatible with that charity that hopeth all things, and ſuſpecteth not?</p>

                     </label> We anſwer, There is a twofold fulneſs of the Scripture:</p>
                  <p>In its parts, and in the whole. There is a fulneſſe in every part, in every phraſe and ſentence. The ſmalleſt filing of this wedge is pure gold. Mountaines of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hang upon the ſmalleſt ſyllable, as the Jewes uſe to ſpeak; ſo in the whole. The whole is a full rule of faith. Now ſo far we agree, but that all of any matter is contained in any one place, (which is here ſuppoſed) will be hard to prove. We are not wanting to the due reſpect of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, while we hold the whole to be a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152975:30"/>moſt compleat rule of faith and manners. That which is wanting in one place, is ſupplied in another. It hath been the ill hap (if I may ſo ſpeak) of all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hitherto alleadged, to daſh upon that Rock, <hi>(ab authoritate Scripturae ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gativè,)</hi> which makes them all deficient in their authority, while the Scripture ſtands for a firme and full rule to all the godly. That the Apoſtle doth purpoſely handle the Doctrine of the Sacrament in that place, we freely grant; but that nothing can be neceſſary about the practice of it, which is not there expreſt, we ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to yield. We are ſure there is that elſewhere which is not there, and we hope all is neceſſary that is revealed. For redundancy is a blemiſh the word is as free of, as it is of defect. Beſides, reaſons may be given, why no mention there, and then, of any preparatory work by the tryall of others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe thoſe ſpoken unto, namely the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were before, and newly admitted into Church-fellowſhip, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith, and therefore need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be called to this again. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ours are borne in a Church, where hath been a long neglect of true Diſcipline, and where an unfitneſſe in many is confeſſed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152975:30"/>by all that are ingenuous.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle in this Scripture eyes Chriſts performance with his Diſciples, where was no need of this examination, they being all formerly joyned to Chriſt, and known of him. You may finde learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Zanchy</hi> the Proteſtant Schoolman (as he is deſervedly ſtiled) making, and in ſome part reſellng your objection, ſo farre, as that this Precept doth not deny the inſpection of others. If none of theſe were of weight, why may not the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Paſtors and Church-Officers well ſtand with that of a mans ſelf? Theſe being not contrary, but ſubordinate, the Precept is not excluſive. It is not, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf</hi> only: Small hopes of that mans ſelf-examining, who cannot bear the friendly tryal of his Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>It is meant (as <hi>Zanchy</hi> well) of ſecret ſins, (we may adde, and of ſincerity of graces) which men cannot ſee in others.</p>
                  <p>But our examination is for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and honour of the Church, and is of that which may be known and judged by others: Mens own is for the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and comfort of their own conſciences. We believe that thoſe Miniſters that hold it neceſſary, (as the caſe now ſtands with our Congregations) to examine others,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152975:31"/>are yet little behinde their Opponents in earneſt preſſing upon mens conſciences the examination of themſelves, charging ſuch as they deal with, not to reſt on the trial and approbation of others, but to approve themſelves to God in the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and judging of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, becauſe the Scripture ſtands for ſuch a fulneſſe in that ſingle Scripture, as to leave out no one neceſſary thing: Let us aske whether a godly Communicant be bound to no other duty, beſides what is there particularly expreſt? We hope pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at leaſt, and ſundry other duties, which are not mentioned, may yet be regarded and practiſed, and have their warrant elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Some Fathers and others do gloſſe theſe words, as is ſaid in the Paper, but not in that ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Their minde was, and ſo is ours, that men ſhould not buſie themſelves about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, neglecting their own condition, nor reſt upon other mens opinions of them, without diſcerning a difference from themſelves formerly, and from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at preſent. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks well, when rightly taken for private examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be in a ſecret place, (where the ſoul may freely have communion with God;) but that which is for reformation,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152975:31"/>and ſatisfaction of the Church, ſhould nevertheleſſe be with witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Clemens Alexandrinue</hi> counted every mans conſcience his beſt director, we hope he meant this of conſciencious men, not of men void of true conſcience, which is the condition of all ſuch as we willingly keep off.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Pareus</hi> is one brought in to ſide with the Fathers, unto him we are contented to hearken; We have ſought the words alledged, and finde him thus ſpeaking: <hi>Non dicit Apoſtolus, Sacerdoter probent, &amp;c.</hi> that is, The Apoſtle doth not ſay, Let the Prieſts examine, or try the Communicants; but, <hi>Let every one exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf;</hi> to ſhew the Reader, what an uniſon this is. We muſt freely point at a great miſtake, and that in three points.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Pareus</hi> ſpeaks this of Popiſh Prieſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of Auricular confeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the following words he is ours, juſtifying what he is alledged againſt: <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina publica, vel privata,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Examina publica, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privata mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimè im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probamus, ſed requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus.</note> publick or private examinations of Communicants we by no means condemne, but require.</p>
                  <p>So that however he grants the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation there commanded, to be eſpecially of a mans ſelf, which we freely aſſent unto.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152975:32"/>yet he is not againſt that which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for. It is here and elſewhere hinted, that our examination is riſen out of the aſhes of Auricular confeſſion; but (alas!) the difference between theſe is eaſily ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the harſhneſſe of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is as evident.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Examination defended is ſometime before the whole ſociety, and never ſo private, as is ſuggeſted: but always before two or three witneſſes at the leaſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Auricular confeſſion is conſtantly, and continually renewed, ſo often as the Ordinance is made uſe of: this is never but once.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Ratione ſubjecti,</hi> they are as wide as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and a Frier or Jeſuite. It is not for want of ignorance, &amp; ill will to the truth, that examination by Church Officers, to finde out mens fitneſs for viſible communion, is counted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a point of Popery; but enough of this. Shortly, he that builds upon the alledged Text, that no others have to do with mens fitneſſe to the Sacrament, becauſe a private ſelf-examination about the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their graces, to ground a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faith upon, is commended; or that it is againſt charity, to ſuſpend any man that profeſſeth himſelf prepared;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152975:32"/>he that layes this upon the Text, layes more upon it then it will bear, and which the Ancients and Moderne approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors will not own, as we hope more fully to prove anon.</p>

Some men reflecting hereupon, and finding their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſmarting for like fins, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecretly carried, were not obnoxious to the cenſures of the Church, to the end they might obtaine like conſolation and quiet minde, did voluntarily ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Churches Diſcipline herein, and underwent the burthen of publick confeſſion and pennance; and to the end this publication of ſecret offences might be performed in the beſt way, and diſcreeteſt manner, ſome prudent Miniſter was firſt acquainted therewith, by whoſe direction the Delinquent might underſtand what ſins were firſt to be brought to the publick notice of the Church, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the pennance was to be performed by them.</p>
               <p>At firſt it was left free to the penitent to chooſe his Ghoſtly Father; but at length by the general conſent of the Biſhops it was ordained, that in every Church one

                        <item>2. That private confeſſion in a right and rectified manner, hath never been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſuſed; the private unburthening of grieved ſoules into the boſome of ſome
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152975:36"/>Chriſtian friend, Miniſter or other in ſome difficult caſes, hath been, and is practiſed home to this day.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>We hope that the Authour may ſee in time, that the Miniſters principles in their ſeparation, and examination are not Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh: We abhorre the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> rotten Principles; We abhorre her, her wayes, and friends. Some of her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples may be good, yet then her infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are baſe. Theſe men pointed at in the Paper do undertake to ſhew, that as they diſlike not that Chriſtian refuge of private confeſſion, which is the very word and will of God:<note place="margin">Jam. 5.16.</note> So they can maintaine their courſe of examination without uſe of the Philiſtines forge, nor do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce anything; only they deſire that all, whether publick or private duties to God, or the Churches honour, may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
                  <p>We come next to conſider, what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from Antiquity, and yielded in this Controverſie; as alſo to ſee, whether this be for the Paper, or againſt it. A ſmatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in Antiquity may know, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients rejected, and ſuſpended divers ſorts of men under ſundry conſiderations, and that they were exceeding cautelous about admiſſion to this Ordinance, no
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152975:36"/>print whereof is to be ſeen in the common practice of our Aſſemblies.

                     </note> as before the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper, becanſe the Word hath the ſavour of death to ſome; and that Scripture <hi>(Caſt not your pearles before ſwine)</hi> is meant of hearing the Word? It ſeemes to us to be below reaſon, to ſee no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween other Ordinances and the Lords Supper, as to mat-of examination. Thoſe words <hi>(Caſt not your pearls, &amp;c.)</hi> may extend to hearers of the Word, this is not denied: but where one applies it ſo, many
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152975:45"/>do apply it to the Communion. So by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Halenſis,</hi> and others of note, Who knows not that diſtinction between a converting and confirming Ordinance?—Some indeed have conteſted againſt this difference, but with ſlender ſucceſſe. The Word Heathens are capable of. Go, preach the Word to every creature. The other is proper to Saints, to comfort, and ſtrengthen the begotten. So that there is not the ſame reaſon for a preced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous examination in theſe two Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                  <p>As to that controverſie, Whether the Sacrament may convert (which borders upon this opinion?) ſo much is ſaid about it by two learned and godly men, as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle can be added.<note place="margin">Gilleſpy.</note> One in a vigorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to Maſter <hi>Prinne,</hi> by whom (though a man free of his pen) no anſwer hath been given.<note place="margin">Ph. Good.</note> The other is a late, cleare, and ſweet diſcourſe. Conſult theſe; we are ſailing with a ſide-winde, being not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged by the Paper, to ſpeak our thoughts, yet we ſhall ſpare a few words to it. Converſion of ſouls is Gods work, who is not limited by his own Ordinances, but is above them, while we are under them; he can without any or by unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied meanes call a ſoul. We read of one
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152975:46"/>converted by often ſeeing a deaths head in a ring, another by a mans falling down dead in his ſight; theſe (you will ſay) are not proper, or ſanctified means. Again, by prayer a ſoul may be converted in ſome ſenſe, As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grace may be then given in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In prayer much of the Goſpel may be held out, as to ſinnes guilt, miſery and remedy, and ſo a ſoul may be wrought upon, this is by prayer, but not as ſuch: The ſcope of it being to beg grace, to ſeek a bleſſing on the Word, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie that meanes. Further, a ſoul may be wrought upon by a Sacrament-Sermon, or Sacrament-exhortation, or one may be turned from the practice of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſin, and may have his converſion cleared at ſuch a time. Or thus, the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament, may be the time of his firſt ſenſible feeling of grace wrought, yet all this doth not make it a converting Ordinance in an ordinary way, ſuch as in faith may be uſed for that end. No, <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.17. which is meant of preaching, as a diſtinct Ordinance, ſee ver. 15. But this is more then we owe the Paper, which doth not affirme <hi>(in terminis)</hi> that the Lords Supper is a converting Ordinance, but only this,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152975:46"/>that the danger is alike of unworthy hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as of unworthy receiving, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examination is no more neceſſary to the one, then before the other; there being no examination before hearing, why before the Lords Supper?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But this conceit hath no conformity with Antiquity, for the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and penitents were admitted to the Word, but put from the other as all men know.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Heare a worthy or two in this caſe. The Word goeth before faith, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, follow ſaith learned <hi>Ameſius. Peter Martyr</hi> ſpeaks thus in <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Moreover,<note place="margin">

The Sacrament is not defiled by their partaking, no more then the Word is by being preacht unto faithleſſe people, and that is no more then the Sunne is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by ſhining upon a dunghill. Thoſe that communicate with them are not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, or defrauded thereby of the fruit, and efficacy of the Sacrament; neither doth God binde us to dive into other mens conſciences; nor can their fraude, or deceits, or cold, formal profeſſion hurt any beſide themſelves. To God they ſeem ſuch as they are, but of us they muſt be taken for ſuch as they ſeem. In the eye of God they are againſt Chriſt, that are not truly and ſincerely with him: in our eyes they muſt be received as with Chriſt, that are not in outward ſhew againſt him.

If thou prove it not, I overcome, be thy ſelfe Judge, if thou doeſt prove it, I am victor by the judgement of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who taught that the barn was not to be forſaken for the chaffe. To forſake the Aſſemblies becauſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152975:48"/>of the mixture, and communion of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and evil men I ſhould willingly know, if it be not to revive the old he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies of <hi>Donatus, Lucifer, Novatus,</hi> and <hi>Audius?</hi> And to make the Church of the called to be of no greater latitude then that of the elect? whereas many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but few are choſen. And as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not withdraw themſelves from the Communion upon that pretence, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may the Miniſter withhold the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from them; for can it be thought rational that the holy deſire of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number ſhould be unſatisfied, becauſe the greater part is careleſſe, and indiſpoſed to joyne with them? Is not this to eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the corne for the tares ſake, whereas rather both ſhould be ſuffered to grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether untill harveſt? And as it is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the reſt of the people to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them, ſo none likewiſe to the Paſtor to adminiſter it to them, ſo as he have by publick and preparatory teaching, and as he ſhall finde it fit, and ſeaſonable and meet with opportunities to do it, by private conference endeavoured to principle, and diſpoſe them to a worthy receiving. <hi>Petitur à te cura, non curatio,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> If thou teacheſt, that is thine; if he will not learne, that is his: take
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152975:48"/>what is thine, and go thy way, ſaith the ſame Father. If the watchman cry, and the City will not be warned, their blood ſhall be upon their own heads, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his ſoul. Neither was the Paſtor of <hi>Corinth</hi> blamed for admitting thoſe that did eate, and drink unworthily, but they were reprehended that came ſo unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; nor were the ſervants checked for bringing into the marriage-feaſt a man that had no wedding garment, though himſelfe were caſt out into utter darkneſſe. I know a man is guilty of every ſinne he labours not to hinder, but then firſt he muſt have a power to impede it; and to ſay a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is impowered to put from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without the party will ſubmit to examination, is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> for that is the thing controverted. And ſecondly, if the matter be neceſſary, and the failer be only in the manner of doing it, the rule holds not, for to crop one eare of a whole harveſt; and to inſtance in one of many caſes, How then could a Chriſtian Prince from a Heathen, for confirmation of a league, take an oath made by his falſe gods?

In much the Paper objects, and then anſwers it ſelfe; there we ſhall not need to meddle, as that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are neceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti;</hi> true, ſo they may be, and yet to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in due manner; and with due care. It is ſtill intimated that ſcandalous ſinners ſhould not come; now we might take this for granted, and ſay no more, but that the conceſſions look one way, and the arguments another; how ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be kept back, if the Miniſters have no power to impede, unleſſe men will ſubmit? no man ſaith, the Miniſter (or any other) hath power to impede ſuch as are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. If the unfit may be ſuſpended it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and if not, theſe the Miniſter hath
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152975:50"/>no power at all. If ſome be ſcandalous, and unfit as is yielded <hi>(in terminis)</hi> then there muſt be a Judge of this unfitneſſe, which muſt not be themſelves, but the Miniſters; and Church-Officers. But to come nearer to the very words, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, we can yield no reaſon why men not ſcandalous, (nor ignorant) ſhould be kept off, our mindes being to admit all that come not under thoſe qualifications, namely, ignorant, or ſome way ſcandalous; if we could know men to be but formal, (that is dead, and hypocritical) though they were not ſcandalous, they ſhould be kept off; for ſuch are intruders, have no right, and are neceſſarily profaners of the Sacrament; but we cannot ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerne this, though we know that there are many ſuch; therefore we ſteere by another compaſſe.</p>
                  <p>We ſay further, that the openly wicked only do defile the Sacrament (in the worſt ſenſe;) ſecret ſinners (hypocrites, and formaliſts) in Gods eye, profane ones in the Churches ſight; the firſt draw judgements on themſelves, the latter on others: ungracious perſons cannot actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and intentionally ſanctifie Gods Name in their approaches to the Lords Table. But if all theſe, and ſuch as theſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152975:50"/>be excepted, there will be no dunghils for the Ordinance of the Sunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to ſhine upon, and ſo no fear of manifeſt pollution.</p>
                  <p>Again, Gods people themſelves may be faulty through negligence; but if Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and godly people do their duty, then though ungodly ones be admitted, they are blameleſſe, and the Ordinance may not be null to them, nor polluted; however, if they know ſuch to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it muſt needs be a ſore burthen to them. Long have godly people in this land groaned (Miniſters eſpecially) under this heavy burthen, from which (as they hope) they may now deliver themſelves. That which is affirmed here, that a previous exhortation on the Miniſters part frees his ſoule, is to us an unſound poſition; for we conceive much more required, and incumbent on Miniſters, and the Church. There is more required: Why elſe doth <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> bid them deny it to ſome? If after he have admoniſhed, he admits ſuch as he knows, (or may know) to be wicked, he ſinnes againſt his own ſoul, by defiling it with other mens ſinnes. The people alſo have ſomewhat to do on their parts, namely, praying againſt the toleration of the wicked, beſides inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152975:51"/>and declaring againſt them that live looſely, and are inordinate walkers, as did the houſe of <hi>Cloe;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.11</note> why ſhould men think that publick warning is enough, while ſome are not capable of the ſight of the danger ſhewen, or of performing the duty of ſelf-examination; others are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and will advance through a ſtorme of the moſt terrible threats? ſuſpenſion is a more effectual meanes, then a bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to teach men repentance; we have ſeen the experience of both. You will ſcarce finde one ſtaying away in theſe Pariſhes, where are warnings, but no other diſcipline; let not men deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others. It is objected that the Ordinance is defiled no more then the Sunne is by ſhining upon a dunghill. We anſwer, the Ordinance may be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that is, profaned, and abuſed, though not corrupted in its eſſence. The Sunne is a natural agent, and in a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical way cannot be defiled: The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth continue a holy, and pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in it ſelf, while it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely abuſed. God is diſhonoured tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet he doth not become inglorious in himſelf, by mens wickedneſſe: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement of the Sacrament is this, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7.</note> wherein the wicked are, is corrupted,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:152975:51"/>leavened, or troubled, as the Spirit ſpeaks; defiled it is unto the wicked through the ſinnes of their ſouls: Yea, unto the godly too, they do become filthy, if they be faulty.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it is fit they ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in a lawful, and due way: But what if ſuch a competent number hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, when propoſals have been made; upon this ſuppoſition, that ſuch might be found? We know of no godly and well-diſpoſed people within our precincts, but may have the Ordinance if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, nor is it our deſire to ſtraiten the Ordinance cauſeleſly; we are joyful, when any diſcover a ſerious minding of that holy buſineſſe. The fewneſſe of thoſe that are accepted is either from mens own unfitneſſe, or from their own unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The truth is, men will have it where they pleaſe, and in what manner they pleaſe, otherwiſe they are not ſo godly, but they can neglect ſo precious an inſtitution. But ſtill the ſtrong hold and place of retreat we finde to be this. If men come unworthily it is to themſelves, the Miniſter can but teach, and warne;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152975:52"/>ſo doing he needs not fear the guilt of other mens ſinnes, for he hath no power to do more. We anſwer,
<list>
                        <item>1. The zeal of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> will riſe up againſt thoſe, who taught not only to admoniſh, but to keep back. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> kept off <hi>Theodoſius</hi> an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</item>
                        <item>2. The partaking of other mens ſins will not be ſo eaſily avoided. Can I clear my ſelf by telling one that there is poiſon in ſuch a cup that will be his death, and yet (he deſiring) afterwards give it him? What a folly is this? But the Miniſter hath no power to do more. That is a queſtion not yet fully reſolved. Though the power be not ſolely in him, yet if it be in the Church-Officers, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and ſurely there is a power to that end ſomewhere, or almoſt all the learned men in the world have miſtaken the doctrine of the keys, from that text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. We ſhould confirme this more,<note place="margin">See the 3d. Section of the Paper.</note> but that we finde the paper in a ſort granting it. If Miniſters have not a power, who have? If there be ſuch a thing to be done, the power is ſomewhere; ſhall we raiſe up Biſhops, and their Subſtitutes out of their graves to leade us herein? Is not the Word Chriſt enough? Alas,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152975:53"/>that a duty ſhould be to be done, but none found to do it; a power, but none to act it; keys, but no hand to hold them. What a vanity is this? If the Schooles be regarded, they impower the Miniſter, as was ſhewed before. And the Authority we live under, did (and for ought we know does) authorize the keeping back of the unfit,<note place="margin">See the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Parliament</note> and unworthy. If you ſay, This is granted you, that ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould not be admitted: We muſt needs ſay, we have obſerved ſuch words often. But how are they made good while this paſſeth ſo current, that a Miniſter hath no power to keep him back that will not ſubmit to his trial, which is here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed?

He ſpeaks of not receiving the weak to doubtful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; men therefore are not to be called to ſuch exerciſes as may be hurtful to them. Briefly, their receiving is this: Such as were more reſolved, knowing and ſatisfied about the abrogation, and burial of the legal ceremonies, theſe as ſtrong muſt deale gently with Jewiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, who were not of ſo pure a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgement.</p>

God hath people of ill ſizes; there is the ſame holineſſe, but not the ſame degree of true holineſſe in all beleevers; not the weak, but the dead; not children, but baſtards do we (purpoſely) refuſe.

We abhor this: we deſire to bring men under Chriſts rules, and Lawes, to finde men able to examine themſelves, to be diſcerners of the Lords body, and that they are deſirous of holineſſe, and conformity to Jeſus Chriſt; this we do try for, and ſtrive to diſcerne: we judge not mens hearts, or final eſtates, but their preſent condition by their actions. When we act in thoſe matters (according to our callings) we build our thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens words,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.16, 17.</note> and fruits, by which we are taught to diſcerne one man from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and good men from bad; It is Chriſtian and rational ſo to judge.</p>

We know no better remedy then to judge our ſelves rightly; we ought to obſerve the inward workings of our own hearts, and to have a judgement of faith of our ſelves. He that judges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf truly, is moſt likely to judge others wiſely, and charitably. But if the godly cannot perſwade others to think well of them,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.5, 6, 7, 8. 2 Cor. 1.12.</note> yet let them rejoyce in this, that they ſo farre know their own ſpirits, that though they be compaſſed about with great infirmities, yet they know, that what they do is not out of pride.</p>

If we hope nothing, and ſuſpect all, we are uncharitable to the utmoſt, we had then as little love, and wiſdome, as now theſe words, as applied to us have of truth. We know ſome, (yea, many) to be knowing, and hope of divers that they are not hypocrites; there may be reaſons given why perſons may be called to ſome tryal and proſeſſion of their knowledge, who are not ſuſpected of groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152975:58"/>the more remote any are from the ſuſpicion of ignorance, the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible will their example be to bring on others of a lower forme: and the more pliant ſuch are, the more will their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility commend their knowledge.

We have a minde to be as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable as others, and as we ought to be, but we cannot ſuffer charity, (as much as we love and honour it) to ſwallow up all our duty. Miniſters may be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable over-much, and are, when they are prodigal of Church-priviledges, (and therein of Chriſts blood,) and when they are ſenſeleſſe in their hopes, as ſome are, truſting all, and trying none: but watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men muſt ſuſpect, and Miniſters muſt ſave ſome with fear. <hi>Paul</hi> was jealous and afraid, was he uncharitable? It is the praiſe of the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that he had tried ſome; charity hath a garment to caſt upon ſome ſinnes,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.2</note> but no licence, or indulgence for any. True charity (as the ſaying is) is not blind: We are not bound to hope contrary to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152975:58"/>our knowledge, and experience; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when true, is friendly to the love of God (whence it ſprings) and to his wayes, and people; it is not againſt charity to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ignorance and unfitneſſe, when the contrary is no way diſcovered. Men ſhew ignorance of their duty in this very thing, that they refuſe to ſubmit to the tryall of their knowledge in ſo faire a way. We hear much of charity, we wiſh we could ſee more of that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces in the truth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.6</note> more then in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                  <p>Some mens charity is ſo great, that if they know a man to be an often ſwearer, or that loves the pot, or ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bench, or have but over-night, (or late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) beheld him in his ſins, yet if he cry guilty, and ſay he will amend; they can next day beleeve a change in him, and that ſuch a one may be a fit partaker of that bleſſeh Ordinance. But (alas!) this is a large charity, which fondly neglects Gods revealed will, and flies to his abſolute power. Men experienced in the work of grace, and repentance will have other thoughts: hell and heaven do not ſtand ſo neere together, that men may ſo quickly ſtep from one to the other.

                  <p>Are we fallen below all good thoughts and hopes? May not our actings proceed as well from the tenderneſſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and love of holineſſe; as from the baſe over-weening conceit of our own pureneſſe? Surely it is poſſible they may. May not a man be humble in his

We are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded he may, we ſee no incongruity in either of theſe. Truly we deſire more holineſſe in our ſelves, and others, then is yet attained, and we judge our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent way conducing to it. When you finde us boaſting of our own holineſſe, condemne us boldly; we wiſh all Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees had hypocriſie written on their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads with a Sunne-beame, we ſhould ſee many a worlding, and Politician de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected then.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152975:62"/>as to the people. But what is it to Lord it over Gods heritage? It is a going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Miniſterial power, and infringing the liberties, and priviledges of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a going beyond Miniſterial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Then if keeping away ignorant, and ſcandalous perſons be not an exceeding of this power, it is no Lording,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1, &amp;c.</note> or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing. That Miniſters are Church-Officers, and have committed to them, as ſtewards in Chriſts houſe, all the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel, is too clear to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, or doubted. This Paper yields (ſomewhere) a Miniſterial power as to the uſe of thoſe two keyes of Doctrine and Cenſure, we deſire but Miniſterial po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. If we act more, we are deſervedly blamed. We ſhall not diſpute (here) the proper, and proximate ſubject of Church-power, as Miniſters we claime, but what doth belong to Church-Officers without injury to the Church. Now if ſtewards of the myſteries of the Goſpel, it behoves us to be faithfull as to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples right, ſo to the dignity of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Did we impoſe any thing not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, or act Biſhop-like in a ſole juriſdiction, we could never avoid this blame. Let Lording fall, ſo rule may
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152975:63"/>ſtand, ſome ſubjection is due by Gods Word to all godly Miniſters from their people. If when minded of this, they crie out of Lording, this is their own fault, and ignorance of their duty. In a way of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, what godly courſes but may be (thus) blaſted, and confuted? With ſome men all rule is tyranny. Some Anabaptiſts count all Magiſtrates Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, ſo do others all Church-power tyrannie.</p>

Shall ſuch thoughts, and ſayings now prejudice Gods wayes? We read that the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> counted <hi>Solomon</hi> a Tyrant,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 9.22.10.27.</note> yet the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> admires the happineſſe of his ſervants, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he made none of the people bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Yea, he made ſilver to be as ſtones, only he laid a tribute for the houſe of the Lord. But they that cannot diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween pride, and power, between pride, and diſcipline, need ſomewhat to clear their eye-ſight. When the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes Lordſhip over the flock, he takes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152975:63"/>not away government,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. ver. 7.17.24.</note> for that were to contradict <hi>Puul</hi> in three places in one Chapter; the Paſtor then hath rule, but it muſt not be tyrannical.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Lording is an overthrowing of the priviledges of the Saints, and godly; but we ſtudy to preſerve their priviledges, and to raiſe a fence, that they may not be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down by wilde beaſts,<note place="margin">Eſay. 5.2.</note> but preſerved in their uſe from evident prophanation. We gather out the ſtones of Gods vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard? Beſides all that is done is by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary agreement, our rules extend but to them that freely ſubmit to them. We excommunicate none, nor meddle with other mens wayes. Indeed we diſcover by our actings what we would draw our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations unto; and that while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to follow us therein, our union with them (in that Ordinance) cannot be comfortable. And this we do as being bound in conſcience to uſe all good means to redreſſe abuſes, and to promote the National Engagement of Reformation. Here now are eſſayes of rule, and order, but no imperiouſneſſe, or uſurpation: When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood for the Prieſts Office againſt the pride of <hi>Corah,</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, they tell him, that the Prieſts took too much upon them.</p>

                  <p>Truth is, only gracious ſpirits are fit to be governed in a Chriſtian, or Church-way. Gods yoke is grievous to the ſons of Belial. <hi>Hinc illae lachrymae.</hi> Is any thing put upon men but the light burthen of Chriſts lawes? Is it intolerable to come under the duties of godlineſſe? is there cauſe given to men to crie out of Lording, and blaſting their reputation, when ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile a thing is required, as the diſcovery of their knowledge, and clearing of their practices from known wickedneſſe?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why not all as well as ſome? Duties of Religion are to be impoſed without reſpect of perſons. It is poſſible (though not ſo uſuall) that the Paſtor may be exceeded in learning, and gifts by ſome of his Congregation, but doth this exempt ſuch from obedience? What if a wife have more knowledge then her husband? ſome particular ſubjects more policy then their governours? will this juſtifie the diſobedience of the one? or null the authority of the other? An hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man may ſubmit to one of meaner abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities then himſelfe; yea then, when they are known, and confeſſed to be ſo; if for no other reaſons, yet to avoid excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152975:64"/>and to encourage others; ſuch as are able, and godly too, do ſeldome ſcruple this, becauſe though they have great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, yet they know them not ſo, as to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them againſt their duty. Again, if the perſons tried be found ſo knowing, it will adde to their eſteem, and not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it in the leaſt. Among other miſtakes this is one, that our greateſt ſuſpition is of ignorance. Alas, many are better head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then hearted. We believe, were the truth known among them that ſtand off from us, the greater part ſuſpect their practice, more then their knowledge. For did they live as they ſhould, and as they conceive we expect, the diſcovery of their knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt before a few Chriſtians would not appear ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a work; yea, ſhould we know any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our charges, or near us, that were ſuſceptible of Catechiſing any of us, we might in policy forbear the calling of them forth, without any other reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Nay, we could ingenuouſly ſay to ſuch, as once <hi>John</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>I had need to be</hi> taught <hi>of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</hi> which was the anſwer (as I am informed) of a Miniſter not long ſince to an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent man, ſubmitting to his trial for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Sacrament. Shortly, we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152975:65"/>envy no mans gifts, but wiſh them more, and their converſation ſuitable. One ſaies of the preſent ſtate of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford:</hi> There have been more Muſes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,<note place="margin">Cor. <hi>à</hi> Lap. <hi>in</hi> Exod. 6.30. <hi>p.</hi> 543</note> but never ſo many Graces as now. We honour Graces above Muſes. We finde it to be a doubt among the learned, whether the common ſhekel be greater, or leſſe then that of the Sanctuary? Some make it leſſe, others greater; we will not go about to determine this; the alluſion (every one ſees) reflects upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Miniſters: however, we paſſe it by. There were ſhekels of gold ſome, others of braſſe, iron, &amp;c. Anſwerable to theſe are the various kindes and degrees of mens gifts; not the largeſt ſhekels, but the holieſt are the beſt; a little piece of gold is better then a great piece of ſilver. Knowledge adorn'd with humility, and engaged to advance piety (of whatever meaſure and content) is after the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel, and ſtandard of the Sanctuary.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152975:72"/>ſay our Aſſemblies are Churches as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, but that they are Churches in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes: and in that ſenſe Pariſh-Churches. They are Churches, as having the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and forme of Churches, but not without great diſorder at preſent.

                  <p>We ſuppoſe the Controverſie would quickly be ended, were the characters of viſibility agreed on. The Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments have paſſed as notes of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, in the judgement of <hi>Auſtin, Calvin, Zanchy,</hi> and almoſt all good Writers unto this day; and although we may and muſt allow diſcipline to have a place in the definition of ſound, and healthy Churches, yet to put all, or moſt upon this one, is unwarrantable, &amp; unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſpeaks ſomewhat to the purpoſe, and (as we conceive) fully and truly, to whom we remit the Reader, Men profeſſing holineſſe and not contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their profeſſion are the proper mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152975:73"/>of a true viſible Church: but ſuch our Churches have, though not only ſuch, which the Apoſtles Churches had not. The forme of a Church is the union of the body with Jeſus Chriſt, which is (viſibly) by living under Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances conſcienciouſly diſpenſed; the forme of a man is the union of the ſoul and body together. Ordinances are the ligaments that tye Chriſt and the Church together. Now the means can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to be with us, no, nor the effect of the meanes, therefore with us is the forme of viſible Churches. Now (having a little cleared our ſuppoſition) upon this account it follows, that all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants borne in our Churches are to be baptized. For Congregational Churches (as they are called) do baptize all their infants, we follow in this the ſame ground and principle. If any object that ſundry of the Parents are ungodly, whoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren we baptize; We ask, whether they can deny baptiſme to the childe of any member, (how offenſive ſoever) before the ſentence of cutting off paſſe upon him? Theſe ſuppoſed wicked ones whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as carnal or prophane) are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, what therefore ſhould hinder their childrens baptiſme? Beſides,

There is ſome truth in this laſt, but (yet) as it is urged by ſome it is but a ſhift: The truth (that we grant) is, that every private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Cenſure does not make a man to be a dogge, but the ſentence of ſuch as have ſome power from Chriſt to keep back from an Ordinance; but the ſhift is this, That becauſe now gouernment is unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, therefore none may be taken, or lookt on as ſuch. This we cannot cloſe with; we beleeve that Miniſters of the Goſpel may act by vertue of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt, upon their own knowledge or conſcience, as to cenſuring, by not admitting ſuch as are ſcandalous. Do prophane men ceaſe to be dogges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not a compleat Judicatory to judge them? No, they are ſo voted by

                  <p>Laſtly, where none are kept back, where no courſes of diſcipline are acted in, but preaching alone, there this Command of Chriſt is not obſerved at all.</p>
                  <p>It is cleare that the Sacrament is holy, and that vicious men are ſwine, then to give them the Sacrament is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane it, which ſhould not be given way unto. But,</p>

                     <note place="margin">The ſixth Proof.</note> Many things for our purpoſe may be drawn hence. In the former text there is a fiery danger repreſented, and detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in unworthy receiving. In the other text a duty towards them that are apt to runne into this danger, and to neglect their warning. In that the Apoſtle would
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152975:82"/>have men to examine themſelves, and ſo to eat, he ſhews, that ſuch as do eat wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily muſt be people of knowledge, and grace; for ſuch onely can, and will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelves. So that if ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination be neceſſary to go before recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, then ſuch as do not, or cannot, ought to be excluded; and the danger being ſo capital, there ſhould be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting thereof in others to their utmoſt. Now it is very certaine that a natural man, an ignorant, impenitent perſon cannot prforme his duty of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore all ſuch ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. That which we examine for (as to one principal part) is, whether people can examine themſelves? which we are aſſured many canot do, who yet are left by many Miniſters to themſelves, and deſire ſo to be. Upon this ground in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, fooles, and mad men are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe unable to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; now ſuch as be wicked men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be (rationally) ſuppoſed either able or willing to try, or judge themſelves, they are ſpiritually fooles, wanting that prudence, patience, and ſelf-ſuſpicion, which are the principles of this examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they ſuſpect neither good abſent, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil preſent, but are full of falſe confidence,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152975:83"/>and Laodecean ſecurity. How ſhould a natural man be willing to ſuch a work? He that lives in ſinne, and is unconverted, hath no principle to walk in the wayes of God freely; he may play the Ape, and do (as to outward works) what he ſees others do, but as for diſcerning in the Ordinance, or ſearching his own heart before, theſe are things far above him.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152975:83"/>of this excuſe. If a Miniſter be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and do not reprove the ſinnes of his Congregation he is guilty by ſilence of their ſinnes, this is truth.

A Miniſters reproving &amp; binding the impenitent in the Congregation by denunciation of Gods judgements may clear him <hi>(ad hoc,)</hi> or as a Preacher, but not as a Ruler or Steward. For if the ſame Miniſter ſhall looſe the ſame men by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the ſeales of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is in effect to tell them, that they are Saints intereſted in Goſpel-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and promiſes, or juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we muſt fear that the guilt which was thruſt out at the fore-doore, comes in again at the back-doore.</p>

In the text we are upon, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Miniſters, wherein by not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the perſons to be ordained, guilt

Men ſtand in the viſible Church, as they are apprehended to belong to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. All this is foundly proved by our Saviour Chriſt, adminiſtring at firſt to Diſciples only, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. Not to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the largeſt acceptation, (for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſed beſides) but to ſuch as were more peculiar was it given. Nor can we without much weakneſs take this to be an accidentall circumſtance, it being fore-determined by Chriſt ſo to have it, and his practice being a rule to the Church. Such as are not learners of Chriſt (as the groſſely ignorant) or ſuch as are not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere lovers of Chriſt, but lovers of, and livers in known ſinnes, how can any man make thoſe to be Diſciples of Chriſt? An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeuerated perſon is far from a Diſciple. He cannot examine himſelf, (as before) not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152975:87"/>act graces which he wants. None can take Chriſt in the Sacrament who have not taken him firſt in the Word. Shall ſouls be thought to extend ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al acts which are carnal? This being ſo cleare it muſt needs be agreeable to the Word, and minde of Chriſt, to examine men in order to a worthy receiving, &amp; wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up to the rule, &amp; example of Chriſt.</p>

<list>
                        <item>1. The uſe of the Ordinance of the Supper to be ſo neceſſary; as that it may not alwayes, nor long be diſcontinued; the command of Chriſt <hi>[Do this]</hi> requires obedience; This is well proved by one of late.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi>
                           </note> But we ſee no neceſſity to cloſe with him, in another point, that while the Church is undiſciplin'd, the Sacrament may be adminiſtred in every Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any ſeparation, which ſeems to be his practice, and judgement.</item>
                        <item>2. We conceive that the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cannot be holily tranſacted by any, unleſſe the ſcandalous be removed: the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152975:94"/>minde of Chriſt being fully againſt it.<note n="*" place="margin">p. 16.</note> Intending it for Diſciples onely, as was there ſhewn. As he that pleades thus, My Church is not Presbyterated; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am at liberty to adminiſter, or not, pleads weakly: So he that ſaith, My Church is not diſciplined; Therefore I make no ſeparation at all, but take all; truly to us he ſpeaks as weakly as the other. The pleas are much alike. Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> his advantage upon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, is by this, that he holds them ſo ſtrictly to Presbyterian principles; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we think it much ſafer to tranſgreſſe a diſputable principle of Presbytery, then to offend againſt the light of the Word. All principles of Church-government are not alike cleare; were we to ſpeak to ſome particular Miniſter, we ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our mindes thus: If you cannot with the godly party of your Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, joyne your ſelf fitly to ſome well conſtituted Church, then may the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by his own authory (without Elders) put back ſuch as he knows to be unfit, and ſo adminiſter it at home; this ſeemes ſafer then a total diſuſe of the Sacrament, or then the abuſe of it by admitting all. We ſpeak of this as to be done onely in a caſe of neceſſity. The neceſſity of Elders
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:152975:94"/>to joyne with the Miniſter is clearer to ſome godly men, then it is to others. The Miniſter is impowered, and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned as to all Ordinances by Chriſt; whether in this Sacrament to act ſolely, or alone, is a queſtion. What if two, or three Miniſters joine and act together for a while, being not ſo well able to act alone? Stands this at any great diſtance from the rule?</item>

            <p n="1">I. How this Doctrine is raiſed. His Text is, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they all drank of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>[all]</hi> he ſaith, were the twelve Apoſtles, and Chriſts whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152975:98"/>whence he gathers his free admiſſion to this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two things are here ſuppoſed or affirmed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they were the twelve Apoſtles which did communicate with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That theſe twelve were his whole Congregation. This is the Baſis of the whole; ſo that if theſe communicants were rather leſſe then twelve, or not Chriſts whole Congregation, then all is loſt on his ſide.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all then preſent, when this Ordinance was inſtituted by Chriſt, did partake thereof is to be granted, ſo far the univerſality holds right; but,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That theſe <hi>all</hi> which dranke, were the twelve Apoſtles, is more then is ſaid, and is (at leaſt) a diſputable point.</p>
            <p>Now to ſuppoſe or begge that which a man knowes to be doubted, and denied by many eminent Divines, this is not Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical. They might ſit down all, (in his ſenſe) and yet might not all continue out all the ſeveral actions which were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at that ſitting.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To gather hence, that all howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver profeſſing Chriſt ſhould be admitted to this Ordinance, ſeems to me weake, and moſt unſound. My reaſons are,</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:152975:98"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe Chriſt did not then call all that did profeſſe him, and ſo belong to him; he had many more Diſciples beſides the twelve, as is well known, which were part of Chriſts followers, though not ſo nearly altogether related as theſe. To ſay that the twelve were Chriſts whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, is but a fancy, however ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the deſigne in hand; Chriſts followers were his Congregation, at leaſt the ſeventy were ſurely part of it, and therefore the twelve were not his whole Church, as is boldly affirmed. Theſe then were but part of his Diſciples, the chiefeſt and moſt reall, as Elders or Officers in a Church may be, ſo that their general admiſſion is no plea for free admiſſion. If all named Diſciples had been called to this holy Inſtitution, there had then been ſome footing for ſuch a Collection; but not ſo, not all, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the choiceſt are called.</p>
            <p>Beſides, (2.) Chriſts words point not out only this generality, but rather by that reſtriction <hi>ye (Take ye, drink ye,)</hi> ſhew us that Chriſt did not intend that ſpiritual feaſt for all howſoever profeſſing; but that ſuch as were his true Diſciples ſhould partake.</p>
            <p>All Diſciples (we ſay) ſhould drinke
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152975:99"/>of Chriſts cup, and only Diſciples, not bare born profeſſors, whoſe prophaneneſſe plainly ſheweth them to want all true love and duty to Jeſus Chriſt. You ſee how ſandy the foundation is on which the whole Book and Diſcourſe is built, <hi>viz.</hi> on a forced and wreſted ſenſe of Scripture. Thus ſhortly of the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. How his Doctrine is managed.</p>
            <p>The management is in three things:
<list>
                  <item>1. Apology.</item>
                  <item>2. The ſtate of the queſtion.</item>
                  <item>3. Proof by Scriptures and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His Apology, wherein he commends his own meaning to be honeſt; ſo it may be, and yet his plea evil; ſometimes the meaning is better then the matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In his ſtating of the point,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He diſtinguiſheth the people of a viſible Church into capable, and uncapable. The uncapable are of three ſorts, Infants, Mad men, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate perſons: all beſides (he ſaith) are capable.</p>
            <p>And why are theſe uncapable? The Church (he will ſay) hath cenſured one ſort; but the other (I hope) are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152975:99"/>becauſe they cannot diſcerne the Lords body, or examine themſelves; and if ſo, then all that cannot performe thoſe duties are uncapable alſo. Now it is ſure that all groſſely ignorant of Chriſt, all impenitent ſinners are unable to do theſe; therefore his own reaſon will conſtraine him to allow the keeping back of others, <hi>(viz.)</hi> as well ſpiritual fools, and mad men as natural. Folly and madneſſe can never be denied to be, where-ever ſinne reignes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He diſtinguiſhes of mens capacity.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) In regard of themſelves, this he dares not affirme as to all in the Church; ſhould he, the very ſtones might cry out, and confute him.</item>
               <item>(2.) In regard of the Church, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and thus all are capable that do, or may come.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But what Scripture hath this diſtinction footing on? Thoſe that are incapable in themſelves, (we knowing them to be ſo) we ſhould judge to be ſuch, and exclude them. Can neceſſary profaners of the Sacrament be capable in reſpect of the Church, whoſe duty it is to preſerve the dignity of all Chriſts appointments? The Church muſt take none but ſuch as ſhe ſees, and may ſuppoſe capable.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152975:100"/>The reaſon to colour this diſtinction, is this: Miniſters are to offer Chriſt freely, (which is more formally laid downe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, here but in a Parentheſis) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an univerſall capacity for all men, [whoever comes.] It ſeemes by this that even Jewes, and Pagans may not be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Saerament, if they come, and aske it; for theſe are called to beleeve, even all that beleeve not within the ſound of the Goſpel, ſo that here he ſeemes to forget his former limitation as to the Church; his Scripture is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. and <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1. which indeed do hold out a free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all ſenſible ſinners to beleeve on Chriſt, but to ground on this a liberty for the moſt inſenſible ſoul to come to this Ordinance, is a <hi>non ſequitur</hi> with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>In the foot of all, he beleeves that none except <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto,</hi> (that is, ſuch as are, or ought to be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated,) ſhould be excluded. Here is ſomewhat more then was before, he ſeemed to ſpeak of actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication alone; now if there be but ſuch as ought to be excomunicated, they may be kept back. Truly this wil almoſt ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the mans market. Such as he ſpeaks againſt do deſire to exclude none but theſe that <hi>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152975:100"/>Church; for this very excluſion is a noting, or cenſuring of them, as ſome wayes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending; Now let the Reader judge, what weight, and light theſe diſtinctions carry, wherein he rather contradicts himſelf, then cleares his matter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His Scripture-proofs.

Here is (<hi>viz. Exod.</hi> 12.) a free admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Why? All are commanded to eate, and all diſaccordingly. But many things may be ſaid to this.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

Gods anſwer indeed there is not an abſolute denial, &amp; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the uncleanneſſe ſpoken of was not moral, it was but for a ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fault; now uncleanneſſe as to ſinnes lies till men repent; here are no ſet dayes therefore, but in that cauſe, God reſolves how long that typical filthineſſe ſhould exclude. Now becauſe no ſuch lawes were given at the firſt Paſſeover, ſhall we infer, therefore it was free for all, which other Scriptures ſhew to be falſe?</p>

            <p>Here is indeed a generall proclamation, but yet you ſee after, <hi>v.</hi> 18. that ſuch as ſanctified not themſelves, and yet came, did highly, offend the will of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ſhould not have beene ſo free a coming, as he ſuggeſts.

            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:152975:102"/>
            <p>This miſtake I wiſh thoſe men would ſee, that would faine make the faults of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to become our rule. What if theſe that were Idolaters, and drunkards did eate? This (I beleeve) is not ſet down, to teach or allow us to admit the like ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ones; but rather to warne us, that we might be more pure. I hope the faults of particular Churches, &amp; beleevers are not recorded for our imitation. Againe, it doth not appeare to me that any of thoſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were ſo groſſe as you make them. How is it poſſible that any one embracing Chriſt, can remaine an actuall, and open Idolater? Idolatry was their great ſinne before converſion, from which they were turned to beleeve in Chriſt. How can it then be conceived that they ſtill retained it? It is true, that they did not keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo cleare, as they ſhould have done from Idolatry, in that they might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preſent (as a Proteſtant at Maſſe) in their idol-temples, or elſe (as I thinke) in that they eat with them, eating of the very meate ſacrificed by the Pagans, and drinking in the ſame cups, in which they offered. This was very baſe, it was in them Idolatry, they were guilty of that ſinne, by ſitting, and eating with them in ſuch a manner, that men given to Idolatry (as you
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:152975:103"/>ſpeake) that is, ſerving of Idols, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords table, this (in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) is very unlikely, if not falſe; do not you beleeve any longer, that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was ſo corrupt, as that they would take into fellowſhip Gentiles, without an utter renouncing their knowen ſinne of Idolatry; yet this you do ſurmiſe (very ſinfully, as I thinke) that you may make men beleeve an over-eaſineſſe in this Church as to receaving members, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſtronger to your own Idol of general admiſſion to the Sacrament.</p>

            <p>To this ſome anſwer, that this Sea, Rock, &amp; Manna, were not Sacraments to the Jewes, but their uſe was externall, to feed their bodies, which had they wanted they muſt have died; but I rather anſwer,

            <p n="5">5. His next argument is from the Parable of the feaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. and, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>This to ſerve his turne muſt ſignifie the Sacramental Supper, whereas it ſeems much more to point unto the preaching of the Goſpel, or the Supper of grace, to which ſouls are invited. It is that feaſt which the Prophets called to, before ever this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was inſtituted. See, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſcope of Parables (I grant) is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative, but you ſhall finde him argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from particular branches, as that of compelling men to come in, which he will have to ſignifie their duty, which is a wilde fancy; rather (as I apprehend) the ſcope of this Parable may be either,</p>
            <p>Firſt, by ſending three ſeveral times, to ſignifie the three ſeveral diſpenſations of the Goſpel. Firſt, as a breakfaſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Secondly, under the Law, as a Dinner. Thirdly, under the Goſpel, as a Supper.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152975:104"/>For that which is a Supper in <hi>Luke,</hi> is a Dinner in <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in that it is a Supper, it ſhews we have now the fulleſt, and laſt diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Chriſt; as a Supper is the laſt meale of a day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it may note Gods ſending firſt to the Jews, who for the generality refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; then to the Gentiles, who were far off. The compelling may ſignifie the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits convincing, or Gods drawing of ſouls to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraines</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle;) and the Spirit of Chriſt doth convince, when it begins converſion; and the love of Chriſt drawes, when it ſeazeth upon a wounded, and bleeding heart for ſinne.</p>
            <p>So that all theſe flouriſhes from this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable (reſtraining it to the Sacrament) ſeem much beſides the minde of God therein. I might note other defects, as where he ſaith, the ſervant brought in the man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wedding-garment, which the text doth not ſay. Laſtly, the man will have a free Table, and a free Pulpit to be one. I meane the ſame liberty and latitude in coming to the Sacrament, as in hearing, which is a groſſe miſtake, contrary to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, reaſon, and Antiquity.</p>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:152975:104"/>
            <p n="6">6. Another Scripture is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.5. where <hi>John</hi> baptizeth all; whence is inferred an equall latitude for the other Sacrament; this argument he takes to be very ſtrong; but the Reader ſearching the Scripture, will finde it weak.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>John</hi> did baptize none, but ſuch as came in a capacity for it, and he required con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſinnes, yea, fruits of repentance too; give us theſe, and we ſhal ask no more. <hi>Johns</hi> example ſerves us much better then him. 1. <hi>John</hi> did not baptize thoſe Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees which he calls a <hi>generation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ipers,</hi> they wanted the fruits he called for; the Publicans came in a capacity, the Phariſees not, therefore checkt by Chriſt; See, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.29, 30. <hi>And all the people that heard him, and the Publicans juſtified God, being baptized with the baptiſme of</hi> John. <hi>But the Phariſees, and Lawyers rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, being not baptized of him.</hi> The Phariſees came to his baptiſme; which might be to ſee the adminiſtring of it, or as ſent. See, <hi>John.</hi> 1.24. <hi>And they which were ſent, were of the Phariſees;</hi> which is the judgement of diverſe godly learned; this might be, and yet they not be baptized: the text is plaine, that ſome did refuſe, if not all: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are checkt by <hi>John</hi> for reſting on that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152975:105"/>carnall priviledge of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; had ſome of the Phariſees only reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they had not been more to be blam'd then the Publicans, for ſome of them reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thoſe that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> whether Phariſees, or Publicans, did all confeſſe their ſinnes, they were firſt tryed by that; now grant this to be done before the Lords Supper in a ſerious way, and we are friends. The drunkards, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane perſons, which he would have freely admitted muſt firſt confeſſe their drunkenneſſe to be a foule ſinne, and take ſhame to themſelves for it, or we may exclude them by his own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for <hi>Eadem eſt ratio utriuſque Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did not baptize any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this triall by confeſſion of ſinnes, which was an act, and evidence of their repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The next Text is, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.41. <hi>Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized, &amp;c.</hi> And did communicate.</p>
            <p>How little this Text helps him, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will plainly ſee, when he hath noted the great difference between thoſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and our multitudes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Theſe were all converted ones, ours many of them making but a dead and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:152975:105"/>profeſſion, ſome as void of the knowledge of Religion as the Heathen, and others worſe then Pagans in their practice. Is it not the mans doting on his <hi>Sacramentall</hi> liberty, which keeps him from ſeeing any difference betweene thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and [ſome] looſe profeſſors among us? I would faine learne from this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, what more could be ſaid of the trueſt Saints, then is ſaid of theſe, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. Firſt, they are pricked in heart, ours (alas many) inſenſible ſinners, blinded, and hardened creatures. Secondly, they affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onatly deſirous after the ways of ſalvation, ours (ſome) enemies in heart, and very croſſe to good wayes. Thirly, they were ſtedfaſt and conſtant in the communion with the Apoſtles, and practice of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; theſe ſtand off from the people of God as hypocrites, maligning and defaming them; what they can, not having ſo much as a forme of godlineſſe, if you expect their cuſtomary coming to the Church.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to argue ſome want of ſpiritual ſight and love to holineſſe, when ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons, only becauſe they profeſſe, muſt be admitted to the Lords Table upon this ground alone, becauſe thouſands of precious godly ones had this liberty of generall admiſſion; in his next let him
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:152975:106"/>teach us how we ſhall know common drunkards and ſwearers to be converted, which muſt be, or this argument dies; it was, I know, ſome twenty yeares a go, the opinion of Chancellours and Officials, that albaptized perſons were to be held regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and upon this account their uſe was to check ſuch Miniſters as did difference mens ſpirituall eſtates in their preaching.</p>

            <p>He very much likes this place as peculiar for expreſſion; See how fancy may bring a man in love, and make him bleſſe God for that which ſhould make him mourne; he judges no man unclean, and yet the Apoſtle teacheth us to call, and account ſome ſwine, even all ſuch as wallow in their ſins. But let us ſee his ſtrength from this Scripture. <hi>Peter</hi> he ſaith was ſcrupulous about admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Gentiles in Chriſtian communion, and well he might, till God reſolved him; I much queſtion whether Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> can ſhew ſo good a warrant for his reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to admit ſcandalous ones to the Lords Table: If he have had a viſion from heaven to juſtifie his general admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, let him tell us; He hath not any clear light from Scripture, and yet he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:152975:106"/>ſo was not <hi>Peter;</hi> Why muſt the Gentiles be taken into fellowſhip? Firſt, becauſe the wall of partition is taken down. Secondly, becauſe God gives of his Spirit &amp; grace to them; I pray ſee <hi>Peters Comment. v.</hi> 35. <hi>In every Nation he that feareth God; and worketh righteouſneſſe is accepted of him;</hi> Such Gentiles as feare God; yea, all men fearing God muſt be embraced; muſt all Gentiles be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? No, but ſuch as believe, receive the Word, had the Holy Ghoſt, and repentance unto life. See <hi>Acts.</hi> 11.1.18. <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.46. The Gentiles upon this account are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted uncleane. If your conſcience be ſo large, as not to account thoſe men unclean, who want all hopefull evidences of grace, yet do not ſo abuſe the Scripture, and <hi>Peters</hi> example, as to make theſe your ſupporters.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To ſpeak nothing particularly unto theſe Scriptures; here are two groſſe miſtakes. 1. That the tender or offer of Chriſt in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152975:107"/>the Word preacht ought to be no larger then admiſſion to the Lords Table; Chriſt and grace are to be propoſ'd in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Word, even to the wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible of ſinne; yea, to them, that they may be ſenſible; but that before men do beleeve, or are converted, they ſhould have enjoyment of the Sacrament, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the practice of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. 2. Another miſtake is this, That we ſo ſtraighten the Ordinance, as to ſhut out poor ſinners from it; This here, and elſewhere he quaintly dilates on, and aggravates to ſtir up hatred againſt god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters. But Sir, I would have you know, that we embrace every poor ſinner, ſo farre as we can diſcerne; and they are only ſcandalous, and groſſe ſinners, ſuch as want feeling of ſinne, and ſpirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty that we willingly exclude; do you no better underſtand who are poor ſinners? Alas poor Froome.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken to his Scriptures, I come next to his Reaſons, and conſiderations, which are ſix, or ſeven, as he numbers them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. His firſt Reaſon is ſhortly this. The Sacraments are a viſible word, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of Chriſt crucified; This Sacrament ſpoken of, ſets forth Chriſt to the eyes, as the Goſpel preacht doth to the eare; 'tis
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:152975:107"/>only to diverſe ſences, there is all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; hence he confidently infers, that the ſame latitude muſt be in communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing; and here, ſaith he, I ſtand as upon a Rock; Now I ſhall try whether he build upon a Rock indeed, or upon the ſand. Sir, you do in this tell us that the forenam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ordinances aggree in their matter, this is moſt true; but that there is no difference between them, but only in this, that they are to diverſe ſences, this is what you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, but do not prove; Some difference beſides in their proper and peculiar uſe, is apparent; the Word ſerves to call ſinners, this Sacrament to nouriſh, and confirme believers. Multitudes of authorities, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the moſt learned and godly might I heap, who are ſo rationall as to reject this Reaſon, but I ſhould argue, and reaſon out the difference between us in this particular. Where do you finde that ever the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made uſe of but to confirme, and comfort ſuch as had already the effect of the Word upon their hearts? Therefore although the Sacrament doth repreſent Chriſt to believers, (which is all you prove, and this is not denyed) yet it doth not follow but the Word hath a precedency, and muſt firſt call and diſpoſe before this <hi>Sacramentall</hi> declaration is propor for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:152975:108"/>eyes; <hi>Go teach, and boptize,</hi> ſaith out Saviour; firſt <hi>teach,</hi> make diſciples, and then <hi>baptize;</hi> this <hi>[de adultis]</hi> is found rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; we muſt not baptize men of yeares, much leſſe give the Lords Supper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome fruits of teaching, appears. Our bleſſed Saviour only mentions thoſe two, Word, and Baptizme for the gathering of Churches, and ſo as the Word muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptizme too; As for the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that follows both. It is by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel phreacht in a proper ſence, that ſinners are gathered <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. Though we be not about gathering Churches (unleſſe our peoples obſtinacy drives us to it) but ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtriving to reforme our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions corrupted by a too long diſuſe of Scripture diſcipline, yet here to perſecute this rationally and effectually, it will be neceſſary that we try who they be that are wrought upon by the word, at leaſt that we for a time keep off them from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance who appear to be wicked ones. We are about I ſay to redreſſe, and perfect our Church-communion according to the Word; our Covenant, and will of the chief Magiſtrate. Now, why may we not obſerve the ſame rule in reforming, which the Apoſtle did in gathering?</p>
            <p>So then, I grant you what your texts
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:152975:108"/>ſay, namely, that the Sacrament doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Chriſt cruſified to believers, but it followes not (as I take it) that it muſt be a proper Ordinance for the ignorant, and ſcandalous to partake of; The Word in its proper latitude reaches to the world, to every creature, to the old creature, as wel as to the new; but if we make the Word &amp; Sacrament to be (as you ſay) of the ſame la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, we ſhall confound the Church and world, which the Word diſtinguiſhes and oppoſes; but you ſay, are there any to whom the matter of the Word may not be declared?</p>
            <p>Sir, the bare declaring, or ſetting forth of Chriſt is not the thing we ſtand upon; we ſet not bars to mens hearing, or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but to their receiving; the Sacrament doth more then declare, it doth ſeal Chriſt, now this ought not to be done, but to beleevers only; I meane, to ſuch as in a rationall charity may be judged ſuch.</p>
            <p>The matter of the Goſpel may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clard to any to the Word preacht, or any other holy way, even to the moſt ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if they will give it the hearing; but it doth not follow, that therefore in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance which doth not declare only, but ſeal, they ſhould have equall fellowſhip; The declaring or ſetting forth of Chriſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:152975:109"/>to the worſt diſhonours not Chriſt, but the taking of ſuch as are ſcandalous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to full communion, and owning them as members of Chriſt, I dare not ſay that this either pleaſeth, or honours Chriſt. The Doctrine of the Sacrament, or Chriſt Sacramentall may be ſet before them, but it is their admiſſion to partake, that we oppoſe; The Sacraments are (you ſay) ſeales as ſignes; As much as they are ſignes as ſeales; 'Tis true, theſe two ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſealing are diſtinct ends of the Lords Supper, they are ſignes to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſeales to confirme. So farre as they repreſent they may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſuitable unto ſcandalous perſons, but nothing as they confirme. Would you have them confirm'd in grace, who have no true grace at all? Your two lame ſimilitudes contributes nothing, that the ſeale is not to be divided from the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we eaſily grant, but you will have the writing ſeal'd to him which is no purchaſer, which is abſurd. You tell us how the writing and ſeal are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered together unto the Church, but our diſpute is about the Churches delivery of them to creatures. Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper were delivered together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, muſt the Church therefore
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:152975:109"/>deliver them together? then Infants muſt partake of the Lords Supper as well, and as ſoone as of Baptiſme. What an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity is this? Becauſe men are under the declaration of ſuch a bargaine as heaven, that therefore the Church muſt ſeal it to them in particular, in hope that they hereafter will have a minde to buy, 'tis pity ſuch ſtuffe ſhould ſtand under the notion of reaſon. No man (I grant) will ſay that the Proclamation belongs to any, to whom the ſeal belongs not, nor will any one (well adviſ'd) ſay, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proclamation or Seale doth belong to a Rebell that doth not lay downe his armes, which are your owne wrods. The Goſpel belongs in a fence to all ſuch as are under it, God ſends it to moſt wretched ſinners, offers them conditions of peace with himſelf, ſeal'd with Chriſts bloud, but the doubt is, whether theſe promiſes, and tenders muſt be actually and formally ſealed to men, becauſe this Proclamation, they being ſtill in armes, this you ſeeme to affirme.</p>
            <p>What you mean by confirming men to come in, I ſcarſe underſtand, I think they ſhould come in before they be confirm'd, or elſe your confirming will prove to be (as it is) a ſad deluſion.</p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:152975:110"/>
            <p>The Authour adds force to his firſt Reaſon by four conſiderations. He had need adde ſome force, for his reaſon wants it.</p>
            <p>His firſt conſideration is this.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> He findes the Goſpel is to be preacht to every creature, and baptizing, which includes this Sacrament (as he ſaith) in the ſame Commiſſion; I Anſwer, the Lords Supper is in the ſame Commiſſion, if you underſtand the whole Goſpel, elſe the Word and Baptiſme are named you know without it; If Baptiſme as large as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, becauſe it is in the ſame commiſſion? I hope not; you know many were preacht unto, who nevertheleſſe were never baptized, neither ought to be.</p>
            <p>The Second conſideration is.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The whole Goſpel is to all, and offers Chriſt freely, therefore you infer, that we, who would have a poor ſoul come to Chriſt, and yet will not have the ſame come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deale amiſſe. Anſwer. Sir, you are a ſtranger (as it ſeemes) to the actings of godly Miniſters, you conceive ſo groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they refuſe to admit poor ſouls, this is your ſlaunder, I told you before of this, you diſtinguiſh not between groſſe ſinners, and ſenſible ſinners</p>
            <pb n="203" facs="tcp:152975:110"/>
            <p n="2">2. That they receive not men though qualified according to Chriſts minde. This is another falſe witneſſe.</p>
            <p>Sir, it is Chriſts minde that men ſhould be qualified with grace, as with knowledge, to diſcerne Chriſt in that Ordinance, &amp;c. And therefore do his faithfull Miniſters look after theſe things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He coming with knowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or requiring and looking after theſe, contrary to free grace? I had thought that free grace had only oppoſed merrit, not caſt off all qualifications as the fruites, and ſignes of it. Cannot Chriſt be free in the Sacrament, unleſſe the ignorant, and ſcandalous perſon be alſo admitted to it? I know well, we muſt come to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, without the leaſt thought of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our graces; but yet he that comes to the Lords Table without this price in his heart, and life, will be dealt with as he was that wanted a wedding garment; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by your arguing you make grace not free, but looſe.</p>
            <p>The third conſideration is an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate one, a very darke, and ſad one; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It doth affirme or ſuppoſe, that the giving or applying the ſeale of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is a proper means to convince, and ſave them. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Sir, the uſe of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:152975:111"/>of the Goſpel in Chriſts owne way, and order is beſt; I am confident you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever read that Chriſt, or the Apoſtles uſed this way of conviction. The experience of the moſt godly in all parts of the land, and of the world, will riſe up againſt this your aſſertion; The ſealing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to men, before they underſtand it, and take hold of it, is the common cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats of ſouls in our Pariſhes. Which way ſoever we take it, it is the ſpirit, and his fulneſſe that doth convince. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the fulneſſe of the Word, but the Spirit; the Word may come with the outward ſeal, and yet not come in its full vertue, as you ſay.</p>
            <p>The fourth conſideration is. That the Goſpel is a Goſpel of peace, but the courſe of ſeparation, or admitting only ſome, this is unpeaceable. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Have you never read thoſe words of Chriſt? <hi>I came not to ſend peace, but a ſword.</hi> The godly will more peacable, and quiet, when the ſcandalous are put from them. You would have a worldly, and fleſhly unity kept up, whatever become of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Reformation. Sir, The peace of the Church will not well, nor long ſtand without a holy uſe of all Church Cenſures. It is the ſweet ſaying of a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:152975:111"/>godly man. <hi>It is farre better to occaſion wrath in the bad, then grief in the good.</hi> We are and muſt be tender of unity, but not inſenſible of corruptions in Gods worſhip. We look upon the diſtempers in many mens ſpirits, their railing, and many created difficulties to the godly to be evidences that the work is Gods, who can, if not calme, yet reſtraine the ſpirits of the worſt; you are told that wounded ſinners are not to be rejected: in your next impreſſion leave out your Proſopopria's, we take Saints of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt forme, and acknowledge none to be ſuch, unleſſe they acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the chiefeſt of ſinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. This is from the nature of the viſible Church containing a mixture, now our Congregations being Churches, they ſhould have this Sacrament in a free, and mixt way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall in this oppoſe you upon your own principles, let the Churches of <hi>England</hi> be true Churches, (as it wil not be hard to prove many of them to be) yet are they corrupted through the negligence of former times, that there may be need of Reformation or ſeparation in our Churches, to prevent ſeparation from them.</p>
            <p>I do not beleeve, nor can you prove,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:152975:112"/>that we ſhould own men for Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for bare profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Sir, We are not about to take this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance from our Churches, but to fit our Churches for this Ordinance; ſo that what you ſay is little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, you allow particular Churches to uſe the higheſt cenſure of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why not this of Suſpenſion, acting in, and for the Reformation of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline according to Gods Word, and our Covenant, whereof you take as little notice, as if you were a man of another Nation. What you ſay about the nature of a viſible Church, I ſhall not oppoſe, only I muſt point at your ignorance in making our ſeparation, and Chriſt to be one. Chriſts is a final determination of all men as to their eſtates. Ours is but a ſevering of ſome in order to their future ſalvation, if they belong to God. We note ſome for ignorance, that they may get knowledge; and others for their wickedneſſe, that they may repent. We ſhould indeed preſume, and (as you ſay) anticipate Chriſts work, did we attempt, or deſigne, a general, or final ſeparation. Hypocrites (as the tares) will grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the wheat to the end. This is all the ſcope of that Parable, but the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:152975:112"/>force of your argument is built not upon the ſcope, but upon the circumſtance, namely the ſervants diſcerning; which is but a branch of the Parable, and added to fill up this Similitude, of no vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prove that known ſinners muſt not be kept off, when diſcerned. The Parable ſpeaks of hypocrites, as you your ſelves ſay well, now hypocrites are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned but by God onely. Is not here a contradiction? If we put theſe things together.</p>
            <p>Let us come now to Chriſts example. What is that?</p>
            <p n="1">1. He converſes with Publicans, and ſinners, but where I pray you? Was it at the Sacrament? I hope not, but at their owne Table. This he did that he might have occaſion to do them good by his Word. But what is this to the purpoſe? We know it is our duty to hold forth Chriſt to the worſt of men, if they will hear us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But in this Ordinance, Chriſt alſo converſed with <hi>Judas,</hi> ſomething you ſay for this; and I could quickly ſay as much againſt it; I will only tell you, what a learned man ſaith to others, that you have choſen a bad Porter to let in men to the Sacrament, nor have you well ſtudied
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152975:113"/>the Evangeliſts I ſee: for you might have found the three Evangeliſts to differ ſomewhat, which might have abated your confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke</hi> indeed ſpeaks of <hi>Judas</hi> after the Cup, but <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> before; and it is the opinion of very many godly and learned, that there is a recapitulation in <hi>Lukes</hi> Narration. As for <hi>John</hi> he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely againſt you. Immediately after the Sop, (ſaith he) which was before the Sacrament, <hi>Judas</hi> went out, being now diſcovered, and in a ſort caſt out, as thoſe words intimate (<hi>John</hi> 13.30.) which was before the Suppers adminiſtring; ſo then what was dark as to the diſagreeing of the other Evangeliſts about the order, and <hi>Judas</hi> his preſence, that <hi>John</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolves, ſaying, That he went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately out upon our Saviours diſcovering him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which thou doeſt do quickly,</hi> which words were ſpoken before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Here is little argument in all this; But he will tell you that it is a poore ſhift to ſay, <hi>Judas</hi> was a cloſe hypocrite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He aimes (I know) at an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection lying againſt him, namely this, That though <hi>Judas</hi> had received, yet this
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:152975:113"/>will not help him, or his cauſe. Had he prov'd that to be a ſhift, which he ſo ſtiles, he had written ingenuouſly, but he ſayes it, and proves it not.</p>
            <p>The truth is, That though the moſt eminent of our Divines, (at leaſt many of them) oppoſe <hi>Judas</hi> his receiving, (which ſhould have moved this Author unto a little more conſideration, and modeſty in faying down his opinion) yet the thing is left by others as doubtful, and ſo hath it ever ſtood in the Church, ſo that there is no ſuch evidence of fact, as he ſpeaks of; if there had, men of cleare heads, and upright hearts would ſee it, as well as himſelf,</p>
            <p>Sir, let me give you and others this Caveat. You know the ſtory of <hi>Judas,</hi> beware leſt your contending for a free admiſſion to the Lords Table, prove not as traiterous to the Churches purity, as <hi>Judas</hi> did to Chriſt himſelf.</p>

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Admiſſion to, and tranſaction of the buſineſſe of this Sacrament muſt be with much charity, and humility; without judging, eſpecially in Miniſters; But this is impoſſible, where there is not a free admiſſion. Thus he.</p>

            <pb n="210" facs="tcp:152975:114"/>
            <p>He ſhews us not the leaſt proof or reaſon, onely flies to his own experience, which is a weak prop. Should a Jew go this way to work, how might the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious doctrine of our Saviour be decried? That Doctrine which is of God ought to bring forth, and continue love among men; but ſee the Goſpel doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. What ſects, what warres, what bitterneſſe from this way? The Popiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected commonly argue in this ſort againſt the Goſpel. Look (ſay they) what ſtirs, and blood ſince <hi>Luther,</hi> the founder of their Reformation: The truth is; That when men faile in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they muſt needs faile in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, ſo doth this Authour; He is fallen in love with a free admiſſion to the Sacrament, (and ſo is the generality of men) and therefore layes load upon our opinion and practice, voting it to be the ready way to heart-burnings, and ſuch like evils in mens ſpirits; I will not ſay, but theſe courſes of Reformation may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and draw forth ſuch evils, but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mens own luſts and wickedneſſes are the cauſes of them. And why ſo much pride, and hatred, and contempt of others in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and other Chriſtians, perſwaded to exclude ſome from the Lords Table?
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:152975:114"/>May we not be humble, and loving too, and yet careful, and tender over the Ordinances of Chriſt? The Spirit of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Jeſus Chriſt (as I take it) carries him to a ſpecial love of the godly. Can we not be loving to men unleſſe we be cruel to the blood of Chriſt? Lay down therefore theſe uncharitable conjectures, and evil ſurmiſes of Gods ſervants: the faithfulneſſe, humility, and gentleneſſe of ſome of theſe is very evident to the hearts of the godly, and yet of a contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you in this matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Your text 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. is not to be underſtood of ſuch forbearing of evil men, as rationally conduces to pleaſe them in their ſins, and blinde their ſouls; ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and bearing with evil ones is moſt ungracious; ſee what follows his ſuffering, and bearing, <hi>In meekneſſe inſtructing,</hi> ver. 25. This all godly ones will ſtrive to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; ſuch as they debar they alſo lovingly informe of their unfitneſſe, and intreate to forbear till they ſhall be apprehended to be in a better capacity. Can you tell us of any won to repentance by your free way? truly we know none; but if we may ſpeak our experiences, as you do yours, we finde very many hardened in their ſins by this indulgence, which you plead for.</p>
            <pb n="212" facs="tcp:152975:115"/>
            <p>Here you minde us of three paſſages of our Saviours.</p>
            <p n="1">1 From that Parable of the Phariſee, and Publican, where you go about to faſten Phariſaiſme upon us, but with ſome molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; not a proud, only a ſtrict and rigid Phariſaiſm; here he is ſomewhat more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt then others who are of his minde in our diſpute. We are Puritans, Novatians, Chathariſts, Donatiſts, or what you will, if we be found deſirous to mend our Church-ſociety by examining and ſevering of our people. But what if this be his own blinde zeal? For, firſt, he knows not that we turn off any poore ſinners: no, we embrace where we ſee any (though the leaſt meaſure of) true ſpiritual poverty, Secondly; I might tell him, that he rather inverts the uſe of this bleſſed Ordinance, and by his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe layes it open to manifeſt prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Chriſt ordained it to be a Diſciple-priviledge, a bond to unite his people, and he would have it lie common even to them that have not the face of Chriſtians in their practice. O bleſſed Lord! open the eyes, and rectifie the zeal of theſe men, who are more forward to ſatisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and cries of carnal men, then they are to advance the Churches holineſſe, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the dignity of thy holy inſtitutions.</p>
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:152975:115"/>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond memorable paſſage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Chriſts freeneſſe in eating with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be a reaſon for a free communion; but I have told him already, Chriſt was more free at the Phariſees Table, then at his own. Chriſt that did eat with Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, did celebrate his Supper with his own Diſciples onely, he took none of them in there; nay, he left out very many that profeſſed him to be their Lord; How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent therefore is that paſſionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation? O ſweet Jeſus! &amp;c. I ſee Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick muſt ſerve, when Logick failes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third place is in <hi>John</hi> 8.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the woman taken in adultery, of whom our Saviour ſaith: <hi>Let him that is without ſin himſelf, caſt the firſt ſtone at her.</hi> I could tell him of a better uſe to be made of this example; though Chriſt knew this woman to be a grievous ſinner, yet becauſe no proof came, he would not cenſure her; he would act ſo as he might example us; not as a God, who knew all things, but as a Judge, who muſt know but what is prov'd. And this may afford a reaſon, why <hi>Judas</hi> was not excluded, (if we grant him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) becauſe Chriſt would not exclude him upon his divine knowledge, as he would not condemne the woman ſpoken of; as to men, <hi>Judas</hi> was as free from ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:152975:116"/>as any of the reſt; beſides, if this be a reaſon why we ſhould not cenſure, and note open offenders, becauſe we our ſelves have ſins and corruptions about us, then why ſhould not this hinder the Church from excommunicating alſo, which he himſelf grants to be a Chriſtian cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? I confeſſe the feeling of our own ſins ſhould make us act humbly, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately, but that this ſhould take us off from cenſuring others in the way of our callings. and offices, becauſe God may cenſure us; this is a meere fancy; God without doubt can cenſure us all, and will as for other ſinnes, ſo for our unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cenſures of others, yea, for our not cenſuring when there is cauſe. Why falls he ſo foule upon the Churches cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? Why doth he not tell the Judges on the bench, that they are ſinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and therefore ſhould not condemn theeves, and murtherers? The Churches ſpiritual cenſures are in the hands of men, ſubject to like paſſions with others, even to all humane infirmities, and if this had been a barre to their execution Chriſt would (not doubt), have found other hands for them.</p>

This is gathered from a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed uniformity of Gous ſervice in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of worſhip; the command of God is univerſal, therefore ſhould be ſo as to the Communion. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some incloſure you your ſelf have yielded, as to children, mad men, &amp;c. All therefore may not do this. In a Church reformed, as to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, all (I grant) ſhould be admitted which are not under the Churches cenſure; but with us hath been a long neglect of diſcipline, with us are multitudes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ones, and no ſuch thing as excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in uſe. The preſent incloſure put upon this Sacrament, is a way to redreſſe our fellowſhip, and communion, which are grown ſo corrupt, that without a purge there can be ſmall hopes of ever ſeeing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or diſcipline among us. Had you, and others the patience to wait till the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es hedge be made up, you might then have
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152975:117"/>your deſired freedome. While the Church is without incloſure, the Sacrament will need one very much; When the ſtreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doore lies open, there is the more need to lock the inner roomes. You ſay, that unregenerate men, who cannot performe duties without ſinne, are not yet to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from any. [You ſay] This is your ſtrength and common thunderboult; ſhould I but ſay the contrary, this were a juſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to you. But to give you better then you bring: you would faine (I ſee) have all duties alike, but this will not be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you. There be duties that be naturall, and there be duties that be inſtituted; Theſe you ſhould learn to diſtinguiſh. There be intiall duties; To theſe unregenerate men muſt be call'd and mov'd, as to pray, beleeve, repent. Prayer and hearing of the Word, are ſuch, that whatever the men be, they are to endeavour, and act in theſe as the meanes of grace. Notwithſtanding that it is any ones duty to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament being unregenerate, this you will hardly prove. Certainly Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not thoſe to come, that cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what he wills, nor diſcerne what he offers. Every one muſt pray to God, and praiſe God. It is their duties as creatures to do thoſe things, and they ſinne as much or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152975:118"/>more in not doing, as in doing. But to receive the Sacrament, this is a duty of men, not as creatures, but as beleevers. And he that is judg'd unfit by his Miniſter or the Church, doth not ſinne in ſtaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had a right to their houſes, when they were thruſt out of them. Such as are of a Church may make themſelves incapable of ſome Church-enjoyment, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their children: So do ſuſpended, and excommunicated perſons. Infants of Church-members, whether <hi>de jure, or de facto</hi> excommunicate, or whether growing mad, and ſo excluded; theſe infants (I ſay)
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:152975:118"/>are borne in that Church, whoſe cenſure their Parents beare.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, that is ſuch a ſtitching, ſuch a Presbyterians ſeame, as your knife is (for ought I ſee) too dull to rip; So farre is this from truth which you ſay, that in yielding the one, they have granted the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

You have no power to turne away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, as a ſteward of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel you have a power to preſerve the dignity of this Ordinance, and to keep off all viſible unworthy ones.</p>
            <p n="3">

I hope the beſt of all. <hi>Anſw.</hi> So (it ſeemes) of the moſt prophane drunkards and ſwearers; but is not your hope faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and your charity blind, and irration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. I know God can turne the worſt. <hi>Anſw.</hi> But his abſolute power muſt not be eyed in ſuch caſes, but his revealed will.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. I endeavour my utmoſt, that all may come prepared. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is good, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152975:119"/>charitable, that your endeavour extends to all; but when you do, or may know by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant experience of too many, that they are unprepared; is not this branch of your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vaine? Your duty is to endeavour to fit all; but, Sir, this is not all, but only a part of your duty. It is your duty to advance ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and order in the Churches of Chriſt, to preſerve the dignity and purity of his Ordinances, to provide for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his people in the uſe of them. This you do not.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. I humbly confeſſe the ſinnes of all. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe God in mercy heard <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> and removed upon his prayer a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted for unworthy coming to a typical Ordinance, therefore he concludes his innocency from doing a like; but ſtay, Sir, in this you are unlike <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he did this once, when upon an extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the people came from far, and could not well obſerve the legall rites; but you (it ſeemes) make this a common practice. You know beforehand what people will come, (that the ſcandalous ones of your flock will come) and you think to preſerve your ſoul from the guilt of their ſinnes by confeſſing their unworthineſſe. Pray for thoſe that come, (the beſt need it) but think not that your praying will be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152975:119"/>to you and others, if you knowingly admit the unworthy.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Laſtly, I venture the iſſue on God.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is good to be ſure keeping to our rule, and not to venture too far.</p>
            <p>To venture without the Word is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, which is evill as you know. It is good to walk by a rule; for then if we venture, 'tis in a good bottome.</p>
            <p>Gods Ordinances (I acknowledge) will be a ſweet ſavour to him, whatever be the effects of them upon others: But while his Ordinances are ſweet, our actings may be ſoure; and when they are ſo we muſt look one day to heare of it.</p>
            <p>Finally, he hints at ſome other preſſing conſideracions from the command, and good of coming, and from the evill of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this Ordinance. <hi>Anſw.</hi> What is here behinde in the bottom, we'll meet with in the other part of the book.</p>
            <p>Ordinances are meanes, this is true, but yet all Ordinances are not alike, as hath been ſhewen. If a ſoul want grace, there are proper means of converſion, and begetting grace, to which he muſt apply himſelf; ſome Ordinances (as this) are both meanes and pledges of grace alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given.</p>
            <p>The Ordinances are baths, but are baths
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152975:120"/>common to them, that have the plague, (I hope not) though they are open to all, or moſt other diſeaſes, Some Records tell us, that <hi>John</hi> would not come into the bath, becauſe <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was there.</p>
            <p>In his upſhot, he makes a weak flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, with the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. and inſtead of ſcrupling the unworthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the worſt men, ſentences them to be worſt of all that come not. I think him a wretch, who deſpiſes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neglects this Ordinance; but he that forbears for a time, either as ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling his owne fitneſſe, or as offended with the undue manner of adminiſtring where he ſhould partake, I am far from thinking ſuch a one more unworthy, then a preſumptuous intruder. Such as are in a capacity, and come not, theſe deal unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy indeed. As to your trouble about neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of adminiſtring, and coming; Why take you ſuch a large ſtride, ſtepping from one extream into another, whereas the truth and your duty lies between both? You need not neglect adminiſtring, that is another extream to admitting all. I wiſh you would avoid them both. If you will not be perſwaded to this, but ſtill practiſe your free admiſſion, who will promiſe you, that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:152975:120"/>none ſhall preſume? I think very many have already preſum'd upon your book to come unworthily, and many more (while you maintaine this freeneſſe) are like to do ſo. Let this ſtick another while on your thoughts, and then perchance inſtead of calling in of all, you may ſee cauſe to call in much of what you have publiſht in this book.</p>
